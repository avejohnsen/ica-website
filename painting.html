        <p class="painting_description">In 2004 the artist began cutting velour paper, traditionally used for pastel, the rich black velvety surface offered spacial and poetic connotations for the artist’s explorations into Black subjectivity. Inspired by texts, film, and music such as The Conjure Woman by Charles Chestnut, Manthia Diawara’s essay “Afro-Kitsch” and Sun Ra’s “Space is the Place,” the artist begins to question the solidity of the Black figure in visual culture or whether the ways in which it is visible speaks to the depth of its subjectivity. Evolving over many years, these cut paper and collage works explore iterations of form around the poetics of Black being. From earlier interventions in Western Mythology to building image metaphors for diaspora and migration, the work suggests a subject in flux, yet held by heritage, healing, and time.</p>

        <p class="painting_description">In a blast of ceramic shards, fragments of North African slipware and pottery made in the American South, "A Dance for Dave," honors the work of enslaved craftsman, David Drake. The notable ceramicist is remembered for carving poems of resilience in his clay pots. Through his work, Drake performs an act of quiet resistance and profound bravery.</p>

        <p class="painting_description">Villalongo’s nod to Drake’s work commemorates an instance of Black perseverance. Drake’s work shares the stage with North African slipware, drawing parallels to the history of slavery dating back thousands of years across continents. During his residency, Villalongo researched the Roman Empire’s practice of slavery. These fragmented artifacts, pieces of the time-space continuum, serve as tragic reminders of history repeating itself.

                <p class="artist_description">William Villalongo (b. 1975) represents the Black subject against the backdrop of race in America. The artist is known for his use of black velvet cut paper, in which excision and collage are utilized to underscore historical erasure and overturn canonical narratives. The results of his approach are dynamic portraits that reference cultural histories, emphasizing diaspora, deep time, freedom, beauty, and metamorphosis. In 2024, Villalongo opened a solo museum exhibition originating at the Grinnell College Museum of Art, Grinnell, IA, traveling to the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, Madison, WI; Museum of Art, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO; and Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA. Villalongo is a 2021 recipient of the American Academy of Arts and Letters Purchase Prize and the 2022 Rome Prize from the American Academy. His work is included in the permanent collections of the Baltimore Museum of Art, Baltimore; International African American Museum, Charleston; Denver Art Museum, Denver; Grinnell College Museum of Art, Grinnell; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C; Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art, Philadelphia; Princeton University Art Museum; Studio Museum in Harlem, NYC; Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo; Whitney Museum of American Art, NYC; and the Yale University Art Gallery, among others.</p>
